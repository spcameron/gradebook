# core/attendance_stager.py

"""
Utility class for staging attendance changes before committing them to the Gradebook.

`AttendanceStager` provides a temporary in-memory store for proposed attendance changes
(e.g., marking a student Present or Absent) that have not yet been written to the database.

This enables workflows such as:
    - Recording multiple attendance entries in one batch and committing them at once
    - Previewing attendance changes before saving
    - Clearing or overwriting staged changes without affecting the Gradebook

The stager supports:
    - Staging single or multiple changes
    - Overwriting or preserving existing staged values during bulk operations
    - Diff-only and active-student-only views for summaries and pending change lists
    - Calculating an overlay of staged + Gradebook values for preview purposes

    A temporary store for proposed attendance changes, keyed by student ID.

    The stager is intended for short-lived use during attendance recording or editing flows.
    It does not persist data between runs and is discarded after committing or clearing.

    Notes:
        - Staged values are stored in a simple `dict[str, AttendanceStatus]`.
        - No validation is performed on student IDs â€” the caller is responsible for passing valid and relevant IDs.
